# The Kalamazoo Arboretum Census App

This repository was created as part of a final project for COMP 484/490: Computing for the Environment and Social Justice to assist in surveying the Lillian Anderson Arboretum. Our app serves as not only a way to conduct censuses of the arboretum but also as a way to interact with a current census (or the most recent one if no census is active) as a whole. 

Our [website](https://kArbCensus.github.io) is available, although currently only to authorized surveyors and admins.

## Understanding this repository

First, to figure out this repository, you must recognize what it contains. All of the code here is strictly related to the front end of the Kalamazoo Arboretum Census App. To preserve security, all other code (such as the API) will remain private for the foreseeable future.

Second, we have tried to keep our files tidy within this repository. Each page has a folder where it holds all of the files exclusive to it. All shared files, such as scripts around authentication or the HTML for our banner, are located within the _shared folder. As for miscellaneous files, they have been left within the root of the directory, whether that be because they have no best spot or because they are typically left at the root by convention.

Lastly, we have tried to leave a lot of comments throughout our files to make comprehending our code easier. Hopefully, we were able to write our code concisely, but we would still highly advise reading through the provided comments when applicable. These comments are the best form of documentation we can provide, and considering the fact our team had only a few weeks to focus on this project, they might be the key you need to bring clarity to our madness.


## Tech stack within this repository

The technologies we used in this repository are as follows:
* Typescript - Our main programming language to add functionality to the app
* Javascript - Used when issues arose with TS
* HTML - The standard markup language for all of the internet
* SCSS - How we mainly styled each page in conjunction with Bootstrap 
* CSS - Appears via a little inline styling along with being what SCSS transpiles into
* Bootstrap - The framework that helped scale our app across many screen sizes
* JQuery - Used to efficiently share HTML across pages 
* Auth0 - How we do authentication

Further technologies can be noted in the creation of this app, namely the use of Supabase with a Postgres database for our back end. However, these technologies are not relevant to this repository;  being familiar with the languages and frameworks above will be enough for comprehension.  


## Further contributions

Beyond the work done by our team whilst taking COMP 484/490, very few contributions are planned or are likely to occur by us for the foreseeable future. That said, feel free to expand on this project. Furthermore, if you are working with Dr. Girdler or as part of COMP 484/490 to improve this app, we will be more than willing to answer any questions you might have as well as provide assistance where reasonable.
